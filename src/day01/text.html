<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
    type specimen book. <span style="background-color: yellow">It has survived</span> not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
    remaining essentially unchanged. <div style="background-color: red">It was popularised</div> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
    Lorem Ipsum.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
    literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
    College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
    going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
    from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
    written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first
    line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

<blockquote>
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
    looking at its layout.
    <blockquote>
        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
        as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
    </blockquote>
    Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
    for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
    sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
